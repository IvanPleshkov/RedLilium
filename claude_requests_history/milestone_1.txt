This document is a list of requests made to Claude Code.

Request:
Lets start! I want to create a FPS videogame as the result of the project.
We dont create the entire game right now, but we will create the basic structure.
Start with an empty project structure. The lauguage is RUST. Graphics engine will be custom.
Create the workspace with the following crates:
- core: This crate will contain the core logic of the game, including game loop, entity management, and basic utilities.
- graphics: This crate will handle custom rendering engine.
- demos: This crate will contain demo scenes to showcase the capabilities of the engine.
Project contains a single demo with just window creation using winit crate version `0.30.12`.
Demo supports also web target. Keep the web files like html and js in a separate folder inside demos crate.
Provide also a basic README.md file for each crate explaining its purpose. Add to readme the instructions on how configure enviromnent, build and run the demo.
Everything else will be added later.
Imagine also how to handle the documentation for the project. and how to connect the code with the documentation. While creating the documentation, 
think about the best practices to keep the documentation updated with the code changes.
And also keep in mind that claude code can read the documentation and use it to answer questions about the codebase.

Request:
I try to build the web target using instructions from Readme but I get this error. It seems Corgo.toml is missing something. Fix it.
